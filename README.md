# Cybersecurity Planning, Implementation and Maintaining for a Fictitious Physiotherapy Center Physio

The domain environment including Windows server 2022 and Windows 10 workstations is simulated in VMware with virtual machines and the vulnerabilities are scanned with a Kali Linux machine. The company has introduction and appointment web pages (see repository physio-web-pages). The company processes customers' health data, which requires understanding and guidance on laws related to cybersecurity.

## Using Cyber Threat Management and Protection Measures

### Protecting Devices with Updates and Software

The Windows workstation was updated via Windows Update. The Device Manager was checked to see if any devices needed a driver update. The Communication Port (COM1) drivers were updated by automatically searching for drivers. New versions of the firmware were searched for on the manufacturer's website. The router was updated. Windows protection was ensured to be up to date. App & Browser Control was enabled. A ful scan was performed in the Virus & threat Protection settings. The Windows Firewall was configured with a few rules.

### Managing Workstations with Management Tools

Windows workstation management in a domain environment was implemented using Windows server management consoles, group policies (GPO) and Powershell. The following management consoles were used: Server Manager, ADUC, ADDS, FSRM, DHCP, DNS Manager, Event Viewer, GPMC, Windows Server Backup and Print Management. GPO was used to implement, for example, password length settings, daily updates of workstations and department-specific public folders. Powershell was used to practice automating tasks (searching for users by name, searching for users in a specific OU, adding a user).
