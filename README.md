# Cybersecurity Planning, Implementation and Maintaining for a Fictitious Physiotherapy Center Physio

The IT environment including Windows server 2022 and Windows 10 workstations is simulated in VMware with virtual machines and the vulnerabilities are scanned with a Kali Linux machine. The company has introduction and appointment web pages (see repository physio-web-pages). The company processes customers' health data, which requires understanding and guidance on laws related to cybersecurity.

## Project Requirements

Cyber threat management and protection measures are used by protecting devices with updates and software, managing workstations with management tools, and comparing different encryption methods and selecting appropriate ones.

Cybersecurity risks are managed by monitoring the information network using various analysis tools, scanning the network for vulnerabilities, and verifying the vulnerabilities of the systems. In addition, development proposals are made to improve cybersecurity.

Cybersecurity solutions are promoted by clarifying laws, regulations and other official regulations related to information security and data protection, and by illustrating cyber threats and corresponding risks. A short and concise preliminary information security guide is implemented. In addition, employees are instructed in cybersecurity or data protection matters.
